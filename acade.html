        "Think before you speak, read before you think"
        <p> To show a few academic related hobbies that I pursue, I put together a few of my coding work! Another habit that I recently developed is reading, I often find myself reading thrillers ( murder mysteries ) or realistic fiction captured from the lenses of young girls. However, after reading a book, called "Sold" which is about a young girl who moves to India from Nepal in search of work, instead finding herself in the brothels of India, her heartbreaking story motivated my <a href="index.html">Human Trafficking awareness</a> project and moved me to dive deeper into this field.  </p>
        <p> To take you through and show you a little more on how my school provided me with a platform to learn more about Human Trafficking. I initially started with reading a book called "Sold" which really peaked my interest and when I was given an option to choose a Social Justic issue going on in the world for my inter-disciplinary unit, I picked Human Trafficking specifically targeted towards women. I reached out to organizations and indivuals to gain their perspective on this topic and later put it all together into a 5-minute podcast. 
You can listen/understand more about the podcast here --> ( "link the podcast")  Ever since, I have been researching and watching videos and reaching out to NGO's to see if I can help. </p>
        <h3> Incorporating my interests </h3>
        <p> As of now, I am interested in investing ( I have been taking a course over the summer between my 8th and 9th grade ) and I am hoping to incorporate it with my passion for raising awarness for Human Trafficking victims. I am willing to reach out and work with NGO's to understand this field! </p>
