          <p> During a school project, I picked a social justice topic and went further into it by researching and interviewing people to finally come up with a solution. I picked Human Trafficking because it was one of the lesser explored topics in school. With something that started off as a school project, it turned into something that I deeply care about and it resonated within me to help the cause.</p>

        <li> 
          Removing the stigma by raising awareness - Talking openly and discussing the topic at social gatherings is important so people can be educated and feel the need to help them.
            </li>
        <li> 
             Donating to NGO's directly - NGO's help rescue these women and provide them with after-care to treat their trauma. We can help them indirectly and directly by funding those who don't have the means to continue providing for these victims. 
         </li>
        <li> Teaching the safety and rights for women at a school level is important! The more people are aware, the more they can do to prevent/not be a victim. </li>
