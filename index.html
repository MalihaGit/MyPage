			<h3>
				What is Human Trafficking?
			</h3>

		<blockquote cite="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-Trafficking/Human-Trafficking.html" id="htintro">
	Human Trafficking is the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of people through force/non-consensually, fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting them for profit. While many think slavery has been demolished, it has now evolved and taken the name 'Human Trafficking', also known as <i>Modern Day slavery</i>. So why is this industry so huge? Many are bought in through the false pretenses of money and promises of better quality of life. Many survivors have shared that, they were pressured to find work to support their family ( often members from families with no siblings and only elders ). Family members of low income households resort to taking up work out of desperation or compulsion. Countries with poor economic status , higher illiteracy and underprivileged sections falls victim to the lies that the traffickers lure them with and unwillingly/unawarely step into this industry. Research shows that traffickers mostly target people with few economic opportunities and those who struggle to meet basic needs.
Human Trafficking includes atrocities not limited to sexual exploitation, physical exploitation, psychological exploitation, economic exploitation. Women are majorly victims to sex trafficking and menial work with little to no compensations. Men are trafficked for organs and modern-day slavery.

					Poverty drives desperate individuals into the clutches of human trafficking, as highlighted by a survivor's quote: "I only did this work because I needed the money." This desperation is exploited by traffickers who target low-income countries where the lack of safe employment options leaves people vulnerable.

						Earlier, slavery was legalized and was a huge source of income/easy labour for the kingdom in most economies, this is why it was not considered as human trafficking. However, now slavery has been abolished under 'The Indian Slavery Act' in 1843 and is being done through illegal and traumatic ways. Many refer to human trafficking as modern day slavery since people are being forced against their will to work and do menial chores.

					Targeted individuals struggling with money, living in poorer places, young and mostly women. Either forcefully picked up 
					( kidnapped ) and assaulted to force them into this line of work. Or they are enticed into doing some work because they are promised things under false pretenses. Then, they are trapped and isolated from the world and transported around to do work with very less income or sometimes, without even being payed.

							To quote a woman survivor "I  learned that I have the power to change the situation around me. I don’t need to live at risk to make ends meet for my family. With effort and perseverance, I can live a dignified life and encourage others to do the same.” Many women go into this unknowingly in search for a job and cannot escape since this system is mostly managed by men. They feel inferior and are trapped for a long time. It is their easiest and quickest source of income to sustain a lifestyle. However, hopefully, like many other women who have broken free, seek to help others escape and recover from the trauma to build a better life for themselves.

								 Yes, over the years ( however now changing ) evidence shows that women are more targeted compared to men. They are treated with more force through methods such as sexual abuse, physical substance, threats of law enforcement and false promises. Meanwhile, men are threatened by debt bondage, restricting financial access and taking their earnings.  This is because society believes that women have less control of financial decisions.

								 Sex trafficking is when a woman or man is involved in activity against their will. They are treated poorly and kept in terrible conditions. If and when they escape, it affects their mental health and causes issues in society. According to many articles,  It is the most common since people are willing to pay for other chores like keeping the house clean and cooking but not for taboo topics as such.
